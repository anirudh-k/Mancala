# MancalaDecision
Objectives:
- Discover the optimal way to play many different versions of the game of Mancala. SEE: I am aware that fully optimized algorithms exist for some versions of mancala. This is not an implementation of those algorithms. This is a personal investigation to see if I can come to an optimal solution on my own. I may in the future implement the "correct" algorithms to compare with my own.

 - Develop a working Mancala simulator with varying difficulties of AI based on the degrees of success for each algorithm.
 
 - Design and implement a machine learning algorithm that trains on each game where the human beats the computer or beats another human. The end-goal is for this algorithm to eventually simulate human play and test it against the other algorithms.
