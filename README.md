# Mancala
Objectives/Ideas for the future:
 - Discover the optimal way to play many different versions of the game of Mancala.

 - Practice MVC, strategy patterns, building my own software from scratch, and maintaining good documentation.

 - Develop a working Mancala simulator with varying difficulties of AI based on the degrees of success for each algorithm.
 
 - Design and implement a machine learning algorithm that trains on each game where the human beats the computer or beats another human. The end-goal is for this algorithm to eventually simulate human play and test it against the other algorithms.
